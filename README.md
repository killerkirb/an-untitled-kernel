is made by ai, if you feel stuck writing your own kernel feel free to use my code as ref for your projects but i highly recommend you to read and search for online docs
and if you want to just see workflow im leaving the final uefi executable on releases (this code currently does NOT work on real hardware anyone that can solve that issue 'll be highly appreciated, it works on qemu)
